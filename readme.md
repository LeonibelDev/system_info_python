# PC System Information Retrieval

## Project Description
The PC System Information Retrieval project is a Python program designed to gather essential system information from a PC and present it in a user-friendly manner. This project utilizes various Python modules such as `psutil`, `platform`, `socket`, `getpass`, and `datetime` to collect data on the PC's hardware and operating system.

## Key Features
- Operating System Information: Retrieve and display the name and version of the operating system running on the PC.
- RAM Usage: Fetch the total and available RAM, and present the information in both absolute and percentage values.
- Storage Details: Retrieve the total storage capacity of the PC's main disk and present it in a human-readable format (e.g., GB).
- CPU Information: Gather CPU details including the brand, number of cores, and number of threads.
- User and System Details: Retrieve the username of the currently logged-in user and provide information about the hostname and network addresses.
- Date and Time: Display the current date and time.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the `system_info.py` script using Python.
4. The program will retrieve the system information and display it in the console.

## Future Enhancements
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a graphical interface to present the system information in a visually appealing way.
- Historical Data Tracking: Implement a feature to track and log system information over time for analysis and comparison.
- Cross-Platform Support: Ensure compatibility with different operating systems to retrieve accurate information regardless of the platform.
